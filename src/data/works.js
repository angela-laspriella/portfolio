      "There were two big challenges on this project: the first one being the instability of the world due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event used to take place on a big stadium full of things to do (even a ball poll) and we needed to adapt all this fun and cool energy on a streaming format. ",

      "I can proudly say that the 7th Edition of Shift APPens was a success. We managed to keep the event fresh and exciting as we introduced interviews, music, online games and much more to the streaming. The competition was hard and entertaining. On a curious note, the winner team took four Playstation 5 home! ðŸŽ®.",
